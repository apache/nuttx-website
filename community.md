### Issue tracker



#### Bug Reports

Found a bug? Send an email to the dev list {{ site.data.project.dev_list }}.

Before submitting an issue, please:

* Verify that the bug does in fact exist.
* Search the mailing list [archives]({{ site.data.project.dev_list_archive_mailarchive }}) to verify there is no existing issue reporting the bug you've found.
* Consider tracking down the bug yourself in the NuttX's source and submitting a patch along with your bug report. This is a great time saver for the NuttX developers and helps ensure the bug will be fixed quickly.



#### Feature Requests

Enhancement requests for new features are also welcome. The more concrete and rational the request is, the greater the chance it will be incorporated into future releases.
