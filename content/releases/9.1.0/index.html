<ul>
  <li>Major Changes to Core OS:
    <ul>
      <li>New Features:
        <ul>
          <li>PR-977 PR-987 PR-998 PR-995 PR-997 PR-1007 Thread Local Storage (TLS)
is now a required feature and used by all architectures
There is detailed information on the implementation and how this
impacts errno specifically in the Wiki article: Userspace errno and
TLS</li>
          <li>PR-957 PR-947 PR-963 PR-969 Provide nx_ versions of many functions
that are used internally to avoid disrupting errno in userspace</li>
          <li>
            <p>PR-965 PR-980 PR-984 ioctl is now always in the variadic form.
Syscalls in KERNEL builds are also more efficient with this as well now.
Previously the ioctl prototype was normally defined as:</p>

            <p>int ioctl(int fd, int cmd, unsigned long arg);</p>

            <p>unless the CONFIG_LIBC_IOCTL_VARIADIC was enabled in which case it was</p>

            <p>int ioctl(int fd, int cmd, …); This form is now the form defined by
opengroup and is also inline with Linux.  Prior to this change there
were issues with making ioctl calls on 64-bit arch since the
implementation assumed that (void *) would be of size long.  There is
more discussion of this issue in the GitHub issue ticket here:</p>

            <p>https://github.com/apache/nuttx/issues/959</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>PR-962 PR-964 Add new interface sched_get_stackinfo that simplifies
interfaces for things like TLS
There are some security imposed rules for using this interface
    Any thread may query its own stack, A kernel thread may query the
    stack of any other thread Application threads, however, may query
    only the stacks of threads within the same task group, i.e., the
    main thread and any of the child pthreads created with the main
    thread as a parent or grandparent or great-grandparent.</p>
          </li>
          <li>PR-1104 Internal function fs_fsopen() no longer affects errno -</li>
          <li>PR-1123 Move task_init() and task_activate() to be internal functions -</li>
          <li>PR-1140 Add nxtask_uninit() interface
This function will undo all operations on a TCB performed by
task_init() and release the TCB by calling kmm_free(). This is
intended primarily to support error recovery operations after a
successful call to task_init() such was when a subsequent call to
task_activate fails.</li>
          <li>PR-1134 Add typedef for max_align_t</li>
          <li>
            <p>PR-1141 Handle custom stack allocations
sched_releasetcb() will normally free the stack allocated for a task.
However, a task with a custom, user-managed stack may be created using
nxtask_init() followed by nxtask_activate(). If such a custom stack is
used then it must not be freed in this manner or a crash will most
likely result.</p>

            <p>This change adds a flag call TCB_FLAG_CUSTOM_STACK that may be passed
in the the pre-allocated TCB to nxtask_init(). This flag is not used
internally anywhere in the OS except that if set, it will prevent
sched_releasetcb() from attempting to free that custom stack.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Bug Fixes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Many private architecture interfaces were using ‘up_’ instead of the
arch name ‘arm_’
This fix is carried over many PRs such as PR-924.  Many files also
carried this same error in naming convention and were converted as
well.</p>
              </li>
              <li>PR-1018 PR-1017 PR-1021 PR-1022 PR-1057 PR-1060 PR-1194 Clean up
internal APIs that were not using the properly naming conventions -</li>
              <li>PR-857 Wrong value for it_interval field in timespec returned by
timer_gettime - PR-902 SMP: On task creation do not clone
uninitialized descriptors
In SMP mode, there is a possibility that a pthread executing one CPU
may create a new task while a pthread on another CPU has allocated
the socket but not yet initialized it. This commit updates the
socket clone test to assure that the socket is both allocated and
initialized before it is cloned.</li>
              <li>PR-911 Use OS signal functions internally to not reset errno that
applications are using</li>
              <li>PR-925 sys/stat.h Change the xtime fields to align with POSIX
standard. Starting from Issue 7 of the POSIX standard the fields
st_atime, st_mtime and st_ctime have a type of strcut timespec instead
of time_t.</li>
              <li>PR-939 openamp: Update to 2020.04.0 - PR-953 lib_vsprintf: Fix issue
where stack would become corrupt on x86_64
This function requires traversing the VA_LIST twice.  For some
architectures like x86 and x86_64 this needs to be cloned first.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Major Changes to the Build System:</p>

    <p>Parts of the build system have been refactored to reduce duplication and
simplify Makefile and Make.defs files across many directories. These changes
are particularly beneficial for boards.</p>

    <p>Please note that if you develop your own custom boards, you may need to make
some modifications to keep your board’s build scripts up-to-date with the
rest of NuttX and avoid a broken or defective build. For details, see
Compatibility Concerns, Changes to Build System, in these release notes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>New Features:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>PR-894 openamp and libmetal can now be downloaded and configured by
build system - PR-941 Remove ‘u’ prefix from userspace library in FLAT
Build so it is the same for all build types - PR-1044 ARM: Remove
support for old redundant gcc toolchains</p>

            <p>This removes support for the Codesourcery, Atollic, DevKitArm,
Raisonance, and CodeRed toolchains. Not only are these tools old and
no longer used but they are all equivalent to the standard ARM EABI
toolchains. Retaining specific support was not meaningful (and they
are still supported, but now just as generic EABI toolchains).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>PR-1148 PR-1149 Improve build time especially on non-Linux platforms
by providing a C version of incdir.sh</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bug Fixes:
Many small changes to resolve dependency resolution issues that would
sometimes appear during parallel builds.  Parallel builds should be much
more reliable now and bugs filed against any issues found.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>PR-1000 Fix broken support of ZDS-II Toolchain with MSYS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Architectural Support:
    <ul>
      <li>New Architecture Support:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>PR-879 ARMv8-M support - PR-1051 STM32G474 support</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Initial architectural support for the STM32G474 family of
microcontrollers. In terms of peripherals, currently there is basic
support for the RCC and UART, allowing NuttX to boot to a functional
NSH prompt on this family. Other peripherals on the SoC are not yet
supported and/or not tested yet. Contributions to enable other
peripherals are welcome. This adds support for these variants:</p>

            <p>STM32G474C STM32G474M STM32G474R STM32G474Q STM32G474V</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Architectures With Significant Improvements:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>PR-745 The full line of STM32H7 chips are now defined
This adds support for these variants:</p>

This resolves a long standing issue with running the x86 port under
QEMU where it would crash shortly after boot.</p>
          </li>
          <li>PR-837 rx65n: Add crashdump support using standby RAM - PR-862
STM32L4: Expose LPTIM timers - PR-868 STM32L4: Extend clock options and
power regulation for based on clock settings
  Interface to select the core regulator voltage according to clock
  frequency range Usage of this interface during clock configuration
  according to chosen clock frequency Option to choose a different
  system clock than the main PLL (there is HSI, MSI, HSE and LSE
  available to use) Option to not enable the main PLL which allows for
  reduced power usage when setting one of the above options as system
  clock, to do this you should define STM32L4_BOARD_NOPLL on your
  board header.</li>
          <li>PR-960 STM32: Add support for ADC features EXTSEL and JEXTSEL</li>
          <li>
            <p>PR-1041 STM32H7: Improve IDMA transfer and cache handling
This resolves an issue where the sdmmc driver crashes at boot when
using writeback cache.</p>

            <p>This also simplifies the sdmmc driver when the IDMA is in use. There
is no need to mix IDMA and interrupt based transfers; instead, when
making unaligned data tranfers, just make IDMA into an internal
aligned buffer and then copy the data. This method also enables
multiblock transfers, and transfers from/to data buffers which are not
aligned on cache boundary.</p>

especailly for partial memory writes</li>
          <li>PR-1045 STM32H7: This gives possibility to send arbitrary number of
bytes from memory to peripheral using DMA also when using write-back
cache
  It was not possible to DMA to/from AXI sram if
  CONFIG_STM32H7_DMACAPABLE=y When doing TX DMA (e.g. in SPI driver in
  simplex-tx mode), it should not be necessary to align the data
  buffers to the cache line.</li>

behaviour of STM32F7</li>
          <li>
            <p>PR-1110 STM32H7: Use FDCANSEL to determin FDCAN clock source if
possible - PR-1165 STM32H7: SPI transaction appears to be completed
before the data has actually been flushed
TX DMA completes before the data has been actually sent out from the
SPI fifo. This is expected, but the exchange should actually wait for
spi tx to finish instead of dma to the fifo to finish. This replaces
the dma completion event with the SPI TXC event for detecting end of
transmission.</p>

    <p>Compatibility Concerns – Changes to Build System:</p>

    <p>If you are building NuttX for a custom board, you may need to make
some of the following changes in build-related files for your board:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Rename EXTRADEFINES to EXTRAFLAGS</p>

        <p>In your custom board’s scripts/Make.defs file, rename EXTRADEFINES to
EXTRAFLAGS.</p>

        <p>For example, these lines:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CFLAGS = $(ARCHCFLAGS) $(ARCHWARNINGS) $(ARCHOPTIMIZATION) $(ARCHCPUFLAGS) $(ARCHINCLUDES) $(ARCHDEFINES) $(EXTRADEFINES) -pipe
...
CXXFLAGS = $(ARCHCXXFLAGS) $(ARCHWARNINGSXX) $(ARCHOPTIMIZATION) $(ARCHCPUFLAGS) $(ARCHXXINCLUDES) $(ARCHDEFINES) $(EXTRADEFINES) -pipe
...
CPPFLAGS = $(ARCHINCLUDES) $(ARCHDEFINES) $(EXTRADEFINES)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>would change as follows:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CFLAGS = $(ARCHCFLAGS) $(ARCHWARNINGS) $(ARCHOPTIMIZATION) $(ARCHCPUFLAGS) $(ARCHINCLUDES) $(ARCHDEFINES) $(EXTRAFLAGS) -pipe
...
CXXFLAGS = $(ARCHCXXFLAGS) $(ARCHWARNINGSXX) $(ARCHOPTIMIZATION) $(ARCHCPUFLAGS) $(ARCHXXINCLUDES) $(ARCHDEFINES) $(EXTRAFLAGS) -pipe
...
CPPFLAGS = $(ARCHINCLUDES) $(ARCHDEFINES) $(EXTRAFLAGS)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>See git commit 459ad9937377a42785692098ff0d73baaa9551e6 in the main
NuttX repository.</p>

        <p>If you forget to do this, memory allocations on the heap probably won’t
work and your user tasks won’t start.</p>

        <p>To see why, tools/Config.mk assigns a value to KDEFINE such that the
preprocessor symbol <strong>KERNEL</strong> will be defined when certain source
files are compiled. KDEFINE is passed to nested invocations of ‘make’
as EXTRAFLAGS. If your board’s scripts/Make.defs still attempts to use
EXTRADEFINES, the preprocessor symbol <strong>KERNEL</strong> will not be defined in
some of the places that it should be. Suppose you’re building a FLAT
build. In this case, include/nuttx/mm/mm.h will not define
MM_KERNEL_USRHEAP_INIT like it should, which will cause nx_start.c not
to call up_allocate_heap() at startup. Therefore, any attempt to
allocate memory on the heap will fail.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename src/Makefile to src/Make.defs and Modify</p>

        <p>This item pertains only to custom boards that are developed in- tree,
meaning under the NuttX boards/ subdirectory. Out-of-tree boards are
not affected.</p>

        <p>If your custom board directory is in-tree and in a board family that
uses a ‘boards/ARCH/FAMILY/common’ directory (such as
boards/arm/stm32/common, boards/arm/cxd56xx/common, etc), then you’ll
need to make two minor changes to your custom board’s src/Makefile:</p>

        <p>(1) Rename it from src/Makefile to src/Make.defs, and</p>

        <p>(2) Near the end of that file, replace this line, which usually
    appears at the end:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>include $(TOPDIR)/boards/Board.mk
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>with these three lines:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DEPPATH += --dep-path board
VPATH += :board
CFLAGS += $(shell $(INCDIR) $(INCDIROPT) "$(CC)" $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)arch$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH)$(DELIM)src$(DELIM)board$(DELIM)board)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>See git commit 6ca46520df38854bf660f9be54957cceede39ded in the main
NuttX repository.</p>

        <p>If you forget to do this, ‘make’ will report an error, “no rule to make
libboard.a,” and the build will fail.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename WINTOOL to CONFIG_CYGWIN_WINTOOL</p>

        <p>In your custom board’s scripts/Make.defs file, rename any instances of
WINTOOL to CONFIG_CYGWIN_WINTOOL.</p>

        <p>For example, change this line:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ifeq ($(WINTOOL),y)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>to this:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ifeq ($(CONFIG_CYGWIN_WINTOOL),y)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>See git commit bd656888f26c92e8832f0e76b395a5ece7704530 in the main
NuttX repository.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove INCDIROPT</p>

        <p>In your custom board’s src/Make.defs file, remove INCDIROPT from CFLAGS.</p>

        <p>For example, change this line:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CFLAGS += $(shell $(INCDIR) $(INCDIROPT) "$(CC)" $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)arch$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH)$(DELIM)src$(DELIM)board$(DELIM)board)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>to this:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CFLAGS += $(shell $(INCDIR) "$(CC)" $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)arch$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH)$(DELIM)src$(DELIM)board$(DELIM)board)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>This option, which resolves to -w when CONFIG_CYGWIN_WINTOOL is
configured, is now appended to INCDIR in tools/Config.mk.</p>

        <p>See git commit 5eae32577e5d5226e5d3027c169eeb369f83f77d in the main
NuttX repository.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove Unnecessary Variables</p>

        <p>In your custom board’s scripts/Make.defs file, It is no longer
necessary to define the following variables unless your build requires
that you assign special values to them:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>DIRLINK</li>
          <li>DIRUNLINK</li>
          <li>MKDEP</li>
          <li>ASMEXT</li>
          <li>OBJEXT</li>
          <li>LIBEXT</li>
          <li>EXEEXT</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These variables have been refactored into tools/Config.mk.</p>

        <p>See these git commits in the main NuttX repository:
9ec9431706fd0eb7c4c4410d84dafff68ff31366 (DIRLINK and DIRUNLINK),
8b42ee421a41214093c0238e479d73a1099b0e82 (MKDEP), and
567962bd6263bf8809fb63c739f6ec668c69c416 (ASMEXT, OBJEXT, LIBEXT, EXEEXT)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Change ${TOPDIR} to $(TOPDIR)</p>

        <p>In your custom board’s scripts/Make.defs file, it is recommended to
change ${TOPDIR} to $(TOPDIR) for consistency (change curly braces to
parenthesis).</p>

        <p>See git commit faf3c0254bb63af89f9eb59beefacb4cba26dd9 in the main
NuttX repository.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove Workaround For Missing $(TOPDIR)/Make.defs</p>

        <p>In src/Make.defs or src/Makefile for your custom board or custom apps,
the workaround for missing $(TOPDIR)/.config and/or
$(TOPDIR)/Make.defs is no longer needed. To remove the workaround,
delete the minus sign in front of include .config. This is now handled
in the main Makefile and, if those files are missing, will print an
error message with hint to run tools/configure.sh <target>.</target></p>

        <p>Change this line, located near the top of the file:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-include $(TOPDIR)/Make.defs
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>to this:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>include $(TOPDIR)/Make.defs
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>See git commit 1a95cce1a3c3ed8b04d1d86b7bd744352cca45a2 in the main
NuttX repository, and git commit
ead498a7883a654b1d542da94a5fab3ce163361e in the apps repository.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Simplify ARCHINCLUDES and ARCHXXINCLUDES</p>

        <p>In your custom board’s scripts/Make.defs, ARCHINCLUDES and
ARCHXXINCLUDES can be defined without maintaining two different
versions conditioned upon CONFIG_CYGWIN_WINTOOL (renamed from WINTOOL).
Replace syntax similar to the following:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ifeq ($(CONFIG_CYGWIN_WINTOOL),y)
# Windows-native toolchains
  ARCHINCLUDES = -I. -isystem "${shell cygpath -w $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include}"
  ARCHXXINCLUDES = -I. -isystem "${shell cygpath -w $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include}" -isystem "${shell cygpath -w $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include$(DELIM)cxx}"
else
# Linux/Cygwin-native toolchain
  ARCHINCLUDES = -I. -isystem $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include
  ARCHXXINCLUDES = -I. -isystem $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include -isystem $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include$(DELIM)cxx
endif
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>with syntax similar to:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ARCHINCLUDES += ${shell $(INCDIR) -s "$(CC)" $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include}
ARCHXXINCLUDES += ${shell $(INCDIR) -s "$(CC)" $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include}
ARCHXXINCLUDES += ${shell $(INCDIR) -s "$(CC)" $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)include$(DELIM)cxx}
INCDIR is defined in tools/Config.mk and resolves to a shell script or batch file that constructs the appropriate command line argument string to specify include directories for your compiler.
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>See git commit 7e5b0f81e93c7e879ce8434d57e8bf4e2319c1c0 in the main
NuttX repository.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Simplify Board Directory Handling With BOARD_DIR</p>

        <p>In your custom board’s Make.defs or Makefile, when setting up build
variables containing paths inside your board directory, a new variable
BOARD_DIR has been introduced that simplifies the syntax:</p>

        <p>Replace syntax like this:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)boards$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH)$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP)$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>with this variable:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$(BOARD_DIR)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>For example, change this:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ARCHSCRIPT = -T$(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)boards$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH)$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP)$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD)$(DELIM)scripts$(DELIM)$(LDSCRIPT)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>to this much simpler syntax:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ARCHSCRIPT = -T$(BOARD_DIR)$(DELIM)scripts$(DELIM)$(LDSCRIPT)
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>You may find the old syntax being used for variables like ARCHSCRIPT,
LDELFFLAGS, LINKCMDTEMPLATE, SCRIPTDIR, USER_LDSCRIPT, or others.</p>

        <p>BOARD_DIR is defined in tools/Config.mk.</p>

        <p>See git commit e83c1400b65c65cbdf59c5abcf2ae368f540faef in the main
NuttX repository.</p>
