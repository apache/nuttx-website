or 5). These boards feature the Microchip SAMA5D3<em>x</em> microprocessors.
Four different SAMA5D3<em>x</em>-EK kits are available</p>

<li><p>SAMA5D35-EK with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d35.aspx">ATSAMA5D35</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The each kit consist of an identical base board with different
plug-in modules for each CPU. All four boards are supported by NuttX
with a simple reconfiguration of the processor type.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS</strong>. Initial support for the SAMA5D3x-EK was released in
NuttX-6.29. That initial support was minimal: There are simple test
configurations that run out of internal SRAM and extended
configurations that run out of the on-board NOR FLASH:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A barebones NuttShell (<a class="reference internal" href="../components/nsh/nsh.html#nsh"><span class="std std-ref">NSH</span></a>) configuration
that can be used as the basis for further application development.</p></li>
<li><p>A full-loaded NuttShell (<a class="reference internal" href="../components/nsh/nsh.html#nsh"><span class="std std-ref">NSH</span></a>) configuration
that demonstrates all of the SAMA5D3x features.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following support was added in Nuttx 6.30:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>DMA support, and</p></li>
<li><p>PIO interrupts,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And drivers for</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SPI (with DMA support),</p></li>
<li><p>AT25 Serial Flash,</p></li>
<li><p>Two Wire Interface (TWI), and</p></li>
<li><p>HSMCI memory cards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NuttX-6.30 also introduces full USB support:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>High speed device controller driver,</p></li>
<li><p>OHCI (low- and full-speed) and</p></li>
<li><p>EHCI (high-speed) host controller driver support.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With NuttX-6.31, these additional drivers were added:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A 10/100Base-T Ethernet (EMAC) driver,</p></li>
<li><p>A 1000Base-T Ethernet (GMAC) driver,</p></li>
<li><p>A Real Time Clock (RTC) driver and integrated with the NuttX
system time logic</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev/random</span></code> using the SAMA5D3x True Random Number Generator
(TRNG),</p></li>
<li><p>A Watchdog Timer (WDT) driver,</p></li>
<li><p>A Timer/Counter (TC) library with interface that make be used by
other drivers that need timer support,</p></li>
<li><p>An ADC driver that can collect multiple samples using the
sequencer, can be trigger by a timer/counter, and supports DMA
data transfers,</p></li>
<li><p>A touchscreen driver based on the special features of the SAMA5D3
ADC peripheral, An LCD controller (LCDC) frame buffer driver, and</p></li>
<li><p>A CAN driver (Testing of the CAN has been delayed because of
cabling issues).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additional board configurations were added to test and demonstrate
these new drivers including new graphics and NxWM configurations.</p>
<p>These drivers were added in NuttX-6.32:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A PWM driver with DMA support</p></li>
<li><p>An SSC-based I2S driver</p></li>
<li><p>Support for Programmable clock outputs</p></li>
<li><p>NAND support including support for the PMECC hardware ECC and for
DMA transfers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>DBGU support was added in NuttX-7.2 (primarily for the SAMA5D3
Xplained board).</p>
<p>NuttX-7.4 added support for the on-board WM8904 CODEC chip and for
<em>Tickless</em> operation.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Microchip SAMA5D3 Xplained development board</strong> This is the port of NuttX
to the Microchip SAMA5D3 Xplained development board. The board features the
Microchip SAMA5D36 microprocessor. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d36.aspx">Microchip
Website</a> for additional
information about this board.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS</strong>. This port is complete as of this writing and ready for
general use. The basic port is expected to be simple because of the
similarity to the SAMAD3<em>x</em>-EK boards and is available in the NuttX
7.2 release.</p>
<p>Most of the drivers and capabilities of the SAMA5D3x-EK boards can be
used with the SAMA5D3 Xplained board. The primary difference between the
ports is that the SAMA5D3x-EK supports NOR FLASH and NuttX can be
configured to boot directly from NOR FLASH. The SAMA5D3 Xplained board
does not have NOR FLASH and, as a consequence NuttX must boot into SDRAM
with the help of U-Boot.</p>

But full functionality was not available until NuttX-7.4. In
NuttX-7.4 support was added for the L2 cache, many security features,
XDMAC, HSMCI and Ethernet integrated with XDMAC, the LCDC, TWI, SSC,
and most of the existing SAMA5 drivers. Timers were added to support
<em>Tickless</em> operation. The TM7000 LCDC with the maXTouch multi-touch
controller are also fully support in a special NxWM configuration for
that larger display. Support for a graphics media player is included
(although there were issues with the WM8904 audio CODEC on my board).
An SRAM bootloader was also included. Refer to the NuttX board

<p>This is a port of NuttX to the nuvoTon NuTiny-SDK-NUC120
that features the NUC120LE3AN MCU.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS</strong>. Initial support for the NUC120 was released in NuttX-6.26.
This initial support is very minimal: There is a NuttShell
(<a class="reference internal" href="../components/nsh/nsh.html#nsh"><span class="std std-ref">NSH</span></a>) configuration that might be the basis for an
application development. As of this writing, more device drivers are
needed to make this a more complete port. Refer to the NuttX board

file for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Memory Usage</strong>. For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing
support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the
NUC120 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX. The NUC120LE2AN comes in a
48-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM. When running the
NSH configuration (itself a full up application), there is still more
than 90KB of FLASH and 10KB or SRAM available for further application
development).</p>
<p>Static memory usage can be shown with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">size</span></code> command:</p>
<p>NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 34.2KB of FLASH
leaving 93.8KB of FLASH (72%) free from additional application
development. Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (&lt;4%) and leaves 14.8KB
(86%) available for heap at runtime. SRAM usage at run-time can be shown
with the NSH <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> command:</p>
<p>You can see that 10.0KB (62%) is available for further application
development.</p>

neither the SPI nor the USB device drivers are fully verified.
(Although they have since been verified on other platforms; this
needs to be revisited on the Nucleus2G).</p>

and offers High-Resolution 32-bit &amp; 192 kHz audio processing
capability. It is possible to cover most of the functions necessary
for a portable audio with only this LSI as follows. It has Dual CPU
and DSP with High processing capability, and internal 1656K-Byte
SRAM, which make it possible to implement large scale program. And it
has integrated analog functions (low-power Class D HP amplifier, PLL,
ADC etc.) so that PCB space and cost is reduced, and it has various
interface (USB, SD, SPI, UART, etc.) to make extensibility high. Also
it is provided with various function including SBC/AAC codec by DSP
and UART and ASRC (Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter) for Bluetooth®
audio. It is very small chip size in spite of the multi-funciton as
described above and it realizes the low power consumption. Therefore,
it is applicable to portable audio markets such as Wireless headsets
and will show high performance.</p>

<p><strong>OmnibusF4</strong>. Initial support for the OmnibusF4 family of flight
management units was contributed by Bill Gatliff in NuttX-7.29.
“OmnibusF4” is not a product name <em>per se</em>, but rather a design
specification that many product vendors adhere to. The specification
defines the major components, and how those components are wired into
the microcontroller. <em>Airbot</em> is one such vendor. They publish a
<a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/obf4pro">schematic</a>. Other software that supports the
OmnibusF4 family include Betaflight, iNAV, and many others. PX4 recently
added support as well, also based on NuttX. No code from those resources
is included in this port. The OmnibusF4 specification mandates the
InvenSense MPU6000 which is included in NuttX-7.29 along with a driver
for the MAX7546 OSD.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Driver Status</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>NuttX-6.20</strong> Several drivers have been copied from the related
GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP. The registers for these blocks are the same
in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into
the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin
configuration logic.</p>
<p>Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because
these peripherals have been completely redesigned: CAN, Ethernet, USB
device, and USB host.</p>
<p>So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals:
SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI,
Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.</p>
<p>Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support
the same peripheral IP:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG
peripheral for the LPC31xx. The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver
has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into
the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration). It should be
possible to complete porting of this LPC31xx driver with a small
porting effort.</p></li>
<li><p>The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32
Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the
NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>NuttX-6.21</strong> Added support for a SPIFI block driver and for RS-485
option to the serial driver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NuttX-7.17</strong> EMC support was extended to include support SDRAM by
Vytautas Lukenska.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NuttX-7.23</strong> A CAN driver was contributed by Alexander Vasiljev in
NuttX-7.23.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NuttX-7.24</strong> RTC and Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT) drivers were
leveraged from the LPC17 and contributed by Gintaras Drukteinis.

remaining issues with the SD/MMC driver and it is not yet functional.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Support for the SPI-based SD card on the I/O1 module.</p></li>
<li><p>Driver for the LED1 segment LCD module.</p></li>

<p><strong>Memory Usage</strong>. The ATSAM4LC4C comes in a 100-pin package and has
256KB FLASH and 32KB of SRAM. Below is the current memory usage for the
NSH configuration (June 9, 2013). This is <em>not</em> a minimal
implementation, but a full-featured NSH configuration.</p>
<p>Static memory usage can be shown with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">size</span></code> command:</p>
<p>NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 42.6KB of FLASH
leaving 213.4B of FLASH (83.4%) free from additional application
development. Static SRAM usage is about 2.3KB (&lt;7%) and leaves 29.7KB
(92.7%) available for heap at runtime.</p>
<p>SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> command. This
runtime memory usage includes the static memory usage <em>plus</em> all dynamic
memory allocation for things like stacks and I/O buffers:</p>
<p>You can see that 22.8KB (71.1%) of the SRAM heap is still available for
further application development while NSH is running.</p>

<h3>AVR AT90USB64x and AT90USB6128x<a class="headerlink" href="#avr-at90usb64x-and-at90usb6128x" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Micropendous 3 AT90USB64x</strong> and <strong>AT90USB6128x</strong>. This port of NuttX
to the Opendous Micropendous 3 board. The Micropendous3 is may be
populated with an AT90USB646, 647, 1286, or 1287. I have only the
AT90USB647 version for testing. This version have very limited memory
resources: 64K of FLASH and 4K of SRAM.</p>
<p><strong>PJRC Teensy++ 2.0 AT90USB1286</strong>. This is a port of NuttX to the PJRC
Teensy++ 2.0 board. This board was developed by
<a class="reference external" href="http://pjrc.com/teensy/">PJRC</a>. The Teensy++ 2.0 is based on an
Microchip AT90USB1286 MCU.</p>
<p><strong>AVR-Specific Issues</strong>. The basic AVR port is solid. The biggest issue
for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash
is inaccessible using “normal” memory reads and writes (only SRAM data
can be accessed “normally”). Special AVR instructions are available for
accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the
normal, general purpose OS.</p>
<p>Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings
used for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf()</span></code> and debug output. These strings are all stored in
SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest
console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory. So, in
order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be
done:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Don’t use console applications that required lots of strings. The
basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application
should work fine. Or,</p></li>
<li><p>Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings
that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Development Environments:</strong> 1) Linux with native Linux GNU toolchain,
2) Cygwin/MSYS with Cygwin GNU toolchain, 3) Cygwin/MSYS with Windows
native toolchain, or 4) Native Windows. All testing, however, has been
performed using the NuttX DIY toolchain for Linux or Cygwin is provided
by the NuttX
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/">buildroot</a>
package. As a result, that toolchain is recommended.</p>

<div class="section" id="microchip-avr32">
<h2>Microchip AVR32<a class="headerlink" href="#microchip-avr32" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>AV32DEV1. This port uses the www.mcuzone.com AVRDEV1 board based on the
Microchip AT32UC3B0256 MCU. This port requires a special GNU avr32 toolchain
available from atmel.com website. This is a windows native toolchain and
so can be used only under Cygwin on Windows.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> This port is has completed all basic development, but there
is more that needs to be done. All code is complete for the basic NuttX
port including header files for all AT32UC3* peripherals. The untested
AVR32 code was present in the 5.12 release of NuttX. Since then, the
basic RTOS port has solidified:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The port successfully passes the NuttX OS test
(apps/examples/ostest).</p></li>
<li><p>A NuttShell (NSH) configuration is in place (see <a class="reference internal" href="../components/nsh/nsh.html#nsh"><span class="std std-ref">NSH</span></a>).
Testing of that configuration has been postponed (because it got
bumped by the Olimex LPC1766-STK port). Current Status: I think I
have a hardware problem with my serial port setup. There is a good
chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet
able to demonstrate that. At present, I get nothing coming in the
serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I
have the MAX232 connected wrong).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The basic, port was be released in NuttX-5.13. A complete port will
include drivers for additional AVR32 UC3 devices – like SPI and USB —
and will be available in a later release, time permitting. Refer to the

<h3>Xtensa LX6 ESP32<a class="headerlink" href="#xtensa-lx6-esp32" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Basic architectural support for Xtensa LX6 processors and the port for
the Espressif ESP32 were added in NuttX-7.19. The basic ESP32 port is
function in both single CPU and dual CPU SMP configurations.</p>
<p><strong>Espressif ESP32 Core v2 Board</strong> The NuttX release includes support for
Espressif ESP32 Core v2 board. There is an NSH configuration for each
CPU configuration and an OS test configuration for verificatin of the
port.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS</strong>. ESP32 support in NuttX-7.19 is functional, but very
preliminary. There is little yet in the way of device driver support.
Outstanding issues include missing clock configuration logic, missing
partition tables to support correct configuration from FLASH, and some
serial driver pin configuration issues. The configuration is usable
despite these limitations. Refer to the NuttX board

<p>Dave Brooks was successfully funded through Kickstarter for and another
run of P112 boards in November of 2012. In addition Terry Gulczynski
makes additional P112 derivative hobbyist home brew computers.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Most of the NuttX is in port for both the Z80182 and for the
P112 board. Boards from Kickstarter project will not be available,
however, until the third quarter of 2013. So it will be some time before
this port is verified on hardware. Refer to the NuttX board

file for further information.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This port was removed from the NuttX source tree on
2017-11-24. It was removed because (1) it is unfinished, unverified, and
unsupported, and (2) the TRS-80 simulation is a sub-optimal platform.i
That platform includes a 16-bit ROM image and only a 48Kb RAM space for
NuttX. The removed board support is still available in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Obsoleted</span></code>
repository if anyone would ever like to resurrect it.</p>
