Status/Open Issues
==================

2015-11-30: The basic NSH configuration is function with serial console
  via the EDBG VCOM and LED and buttons support.  SD card slot also appear
  to be fully functional.

See also boards/arm/samv7/samv70-xplained/README.txt

Serial Console
==============

The SAME70-QMTECH has no on-board RS-232 drivers so it will be necessary to
use either the VCOM or an external RS-232 driver.  Here are some options.

  - Arduino Serial Shield:  One option is to use an Arduino-compatible
    serial shield.  This will use the RXD and TXD signals available at pins
    0 an 1, respectively, of the Arduino &quot;Digital Low&quot; connector.  On the
    SAME70-QMTECH board, this corresponds to UART3:

    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------
    Pin on SAME70 Arduino Arduino SAME70
    J503   PIO    Name    Pin     Function
    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------
      1    PD28   D0/RX0  0       URXD3
      2    PD30   D1/TX0  1       UTXD3
    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------

    In this configuration, an external RS232 driver can also be used
    instead of the shield.  Simply connext as follows:

    --------- -----------
    Arduino   RS-232
    Pin Label Connection
    --------- -----------
    D0 (RXD)  RX
    D1 (TXD)  TX
    GND       GND
    5VO       Vcc
    --------- -----------

SD Card
=======

Card Slot
---------
The SAM E70 QMTECH has one standard SD card connector that is connected to
the High Speed Multimedia Card Interface (HSMCI) of the SAM E70.
SD card connector:

  ------ -----------------
  SAME70 SAME70
  Pin    Function
  ------ -----------------
  PA30   MCDA0 (DAT0)
  PA31   MCDA1 (DAT1)
  PA26   MCDA2 (DAT2)
  PA27   MCDA3 (DAT3)
  PA25   MCCK (CLK)
  PA28   MCCDA (CMD)
  N/A    Card Detect (C/D)
  ------ -----------------

Configuration Settings
----------------------
Enabling HSMCI support. The SAME70-QMTECH provides a one, full-size SD memory
card slots.  The full size SD card slot connects via HSMCI0.  Support for
the SD slots can be enabled with the following settings:

  System Type-&gt;SAMV7 Peripheral Selection
    CONFIG_SAMV7_HSMCI0=y                 : To enable HSMCI0 support
    CONFIG_SAMV7_XDMAC=y                  : XDMAC is needed by HSMCI0/1

  System Type
    CONFIG_SAMV7_GPIO_IRQ=y               : PIO interrupts needed
    CONFIG_SAMV7_GPIOD_IRQ=y              : Card detect pin is on PD18

  Device Drivers -&gt; MMC/SD Driver Support
    CONFIG_MMCSD=y                        : Enable MMC/SD support
    CONFIG_MMSCD_NSLOTS=1                 : One slot per driver instance
    CONFIG_MMCSD_MULTIBLOCK_LIMIT=1       : (REVISIT)
    CONFIG_MMCSD_HAVE_CARDDETECT=y        : Supports card-detect PIOs
    CONFIG_MMCSD_MMCSUPPORT=n             : Interferes with some SD cards
    CONFIG_MMCSD_SPI=n                    : No SPI-based MMC/SD support
    CONFIG_MMCSD_SDIO=y                   : SDIO-based MMC/SD support
    CONFIG_SDIO_DMA=y                     : Use SDIO DMA
    CONFIG_SDIO_BLOCKSETUP=y              : Needs to know block sizes

  RTOS Features -&gt; Work Queue Support
    CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE=y              : Driver needs work queue support

  Application Configuration -&gt; NSH Library
    CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y                 : NSH board-initialization, OR
    CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE=y

Using the SD card
-----------------

1) After booting, the HSCMI device will appear as /dev/mmcsd0.

2) If you try mounting an SD card with nothing in the slot, the mount will
   fail:

     nsh&gt; mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sd0
     nsh: mount: mount failed: 19

   NSH can be configured to provide errors as strings instead of
   numbers.  But in this case, only the error number is reported.  The
   error numbers can be found in nuttx/include/errno.h:

     #define ENODEV              19
     #define ENODEV_STR          &quot;No such device&quot;

   So the mount command is saying that there is no device or, more
   correctly, that there is no card in the SD card slot.

3) Inserted the SD card.  Then the mount should succeed.

    nsh&gt; mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sd0
    nsh&gt; ls /mnt/sd1
    /mnt/sd1:
     atest.txt
    nsh&gt; cat /mnt/sd1/atest.txt
    This is a test

   NOTE:  See the next section entitled &quot;Auto-Mounter&quot; for another way
   to mount your SD card.

4) Before removing the card, you must umount the file system.  This is
   equivalent to &quot;ejecting&quot; or &quot;safely removing&quot; the card on Windows:  It
   flushes any cached data to an SD card and makes the SD card unavailable
   to the applications.

     nsh&gt; umount -t /mnt/sd0

   It is now safe to remove the card.  NuttX provides into callbacks
   that can be used by an application to automatically unmount the
   volume when it is removed.  But those callbacks are not used in
   these configurations.

Auto-Mounter
============

  NuttX implements an auto-mounter than can make working with SD cards
  easier.  With the auto-mounter, the file system will be automatically
  mounted when the SD card is inserted into the HSMCI slot and automatically
  unmounted when the SD card is removed.

  Here is a sample configuration for the auto-mounter:

    File System Configuration
      CONFIG_FS_AUTOMOUNTER=y

    Board-Specific Options
      CONFIG_SAMV7_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT=y
      CONFIG_SAMV7_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_FSTYPE=&quot;vfat&quot;
      CONFIG_SAMV7_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_BLKDEV=&quot;/dev/mmcsd0&quot;
      CONFIG_SAMV7_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_MOUNTPOINT=&quot;/mnt/sdcard&quot;
      CONFIG_SAMV7_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_DDELAY=1000
      CONFIG_SAMV7_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_UDELAY=2000

  WARNING:  SD cards should never be removed without first unmounting
  them.  This is to avoid data and possible corruption of the file
  system.  Certainly this is the case if you are writing to the SD card
  at the time of the removal.  If you use the SD card for read-only access,
  however, then I cannot think of any reason why removing the card without
  mounting would be harmful.

LEDs and Buttons
================

LEDs
----
A single LED is available driven by PA14.

This LED is not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
include/board.h and src/sam_autoleds.c. The LED is used to encode
OS-related events as follows:

  ------------------- ----------------------- ------
  SYMBOL              Meaning                 LED
  ------------------- ----------------------- ------
  LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF
  LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF
  LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF
  LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON
  LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt         N/C
  LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler     N/C
  LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
  LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH

Thus if the LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
apparently, running normally.  If the LED is flashing at approximately
2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

Buttons
-------
SAM E70 QMTECH contains two mechanical buttons. One button is the RESET
button connected to the SAM E70 reset line and the other, PA21, is a generic
user configurable button. When a button is pressed it will drive the I/O
line to GND.

NOTE: There are no pull-up resistors connected to the generic user buttons
so it is necessary to enable the internal pull-up in the SAM E70 to use the
button.

SPI Slave
=========

  An interrupt driven SPI slave driver as added on 2015-08-09 but has not
  been verified as of this writing. See discussion in include/nuttx/spi/slave.h
  and below.

  I do not yet have a design that supports SPI slave DMA.  And, under
  certain, very limited conditions, I think it can be done.  Those
  certain conditions are:

  a) The master does not tie the chip select to ground.  The master must
     raise chip select at the end of the transfer.  Then I do not need to
     know the length of the transfer; I can cancel the DMA when the chip
     is de-selected.

  b) The protocol includes a dummy read after sending the command.  This
     is very common in SPI device and should not be an issue if it is
     specified.   This dummy read time provides time to set up the DMA.
     So the protocol would be:

     i)   Master drops the chip select.
     ii)  Master sends the command which will indicate whether the master
          is reading, writing, or exchanging data.  The master discards
          the garbage return value.
     iii) Slave is interrupted when the command word is received.  The
          SPI device then decodes the command word and setups up the
          subsequent DMA.
     iv)  Master sends a dummy word and discards the return value.
          During the bit times to shift the dummy word, the slave has time
          to set up the DMA.
     v)   Master then reads or writes (or exchanges) the data  If the DMA
          is in place, the transfer should continue normally.
     vi)  At the end of the data transfer the master raises the chip
     select.

   c) There are limitations in the word time, i.e., the time between the
      interrupt for each word shifted in from the master.

  The controller driver will get events after the receipt of each word in
  ii), iv), and v).  The time between each word will be:

    word-time = nbits * bit time + inter-word-gap

  So for an 8 bit interface at 20MHz, the words will be received from the
  master a 8 * 50nsec = 400 nsec + inter-word-gap.  That is the time
  during which the dummy word would be shifted and during which we
  receive the interrupt for the command word, interpret the command word,
  and to set up the DMA for the remaining word transfer.  I don&#39;t think
  that is possible, at least not at 20 MHz.

  That is far too fast even for the interrupt driven solution that I have
  in place now.  It could not work at 20MHz.  If we suppose that interrupt
  processing is around 1 usec, then an 8 bit interface could not have bit
  times more than 125 nsec or 8 KHz.  Interrupt handling should be faster
  than 1 usec, but not a lot faster.  I have not benchmarked it.  NuttX
  also supports special, zero latency interrupts that could bring the
  interrupt time down even more.

  Note that we would also have a little more processing time if you used
  16-bit SPI word size.

  Note also that the interrupt driven approach would have this same basic
  performance limitation with the additional disadvantage that:

  a) The driver will receive two interrupts per word exchanged:

     i)  One interrupt will be received when the word is shifted in from
         the master (at the end of 8-bit times).  This is a data received
         interrupt.

     ii) And another interrupt when the next words moved to the shift-out
         register, freeing up the transmit holding register.  This is the
         data sent interrupt.

     The ii) event should be very soon after the i) event.

     Without DMA, the only way to reduce the interrupt rate would be to add
     interrupt-level polling to detect the when transmit holding register
     is available.  That is not really a good idea.

  b) It will hog all of the CPU for the duration of the transfer).

Tickless OS
===========

  Background
  ----------
  By default, a NuttX configuration uses a periodic timer interrupt that
  drives all system timing. The timer is provided by architecture-specific
  code that calls into NuttX at a rate controlled by CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK.
  The default value of CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK is 10000 microseconds which
  corresponds to a timer interrupt rate of 100 Hz.

  An option is to configure NuttX to operation in a &quot;tickless&quot; mode. Some
  limitations of default system timer are, in increasing order of
  importance:

  - Overhead: Although the CPU usage of the system timer interrupt at 100Hz
    is really very low, it is still mostly wasted processing time. One most
    timer interrupts, there is really nothing that needs be done other than
    incrementing the counter.
  - Resolution: Resolution of all system timing is also determined by
    CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK. So nothing that be time with resolution finer than
    10 milliseconds be default. To increase this resolution,
    CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK an be reduced. However, then the system timer
    interrupts use more of the CPU bandwidth processing useless interrupts.
  - Power Usage: But the biggest issue is power usage. When the system is
    IDLE, it enters a light, low-power mode (for ARMs, this mode is entered
    with the wfi or wfe instructions for example). But each interrupt
    awakens the system from this low power mode. Therefore, higher rates
    of interrupts cause greater power consumption.

  The so-called Tickless OS provides one solution to issue. The basic
  concept here is that the periodic, timer interrupt is eliminated and
  replaced with a one-shot, interval timer. It becomes event driven
  instead of polled: The default system timer is a polled design. On
  each interrupt, the NuttX logic checks if it needs to do anything
  and, if so, it does it.

  Using an interval timer, one can anticipate when the next interesting
  OS event will occur, program the interval time and wait for it to fire.
  When the interval time fires, then the scheduled activity is performed.

  Configuration
  -------------
  The following configuration options will enable support for the Tickless
  OS for the SAMV7 platforms using TC0 channels 0-3 (other timers or
  timer channels could be used making the obvious substitutions):

    RTOS Features -&gt; Clocks and Timers
      CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS=y          : Configures the RTOS in tickless mode
      CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS_ALARM=n    : (option not implemented)
      CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS_LIMIT_MAX_SLEEP=y

    System Type -&gt; SAMV7 Peripheral Support
      CONFIG_SAMV7_TC0=y               : Enable TC0 (TC channels 0-3

    System Type -&gt; Timer/counter Configuration
      CONFIG_SAMV7_ONESHOT=y           : Enables one-shot timer wrapper
      CONFIG_SAMV7_FREERUN=y           : Enabled free-running timer wrapper
      CONFIG_SAMV7_TICKLESS_ONESHOT=0  : Selects TC0 channel 0 for the one-shot
      CONFIG_SAMV7_TICKLESS_FREERUN=1  : Selects TC0 channel 1 for the free-
                                       : running timer

  The resolution of the clock is provided by the CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK
  setting in the configuration file.

  NOTE: In most cases, the slow clock will be used as the timer/counter
  input.  The SAME70-Xplained board has pads for a 32.768KHz crystal,
  however, the boad ships with that position unpopulated.  So, be default
  this will probably end up using the slow RC oscillator which will give
  you very bad timing.

  If you add a crystal to your board, you can select to use it with the
  definition BOARD_HAVE_SLOWXTAL in the boards/arm/samv7/same70-qmtech/board.h
  file.

  The slow clock has a resolution of about 30.518 microseconds.  Ideally,
  the value of CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK should be the exact clock resolution.
  Otherwise there will be cumulative timing inaccuracies.  But a choice
  choice of:

    CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK=31

  will have an error of 0.6%  and will have inaccuracies that will
  effect the time due to long term error build-up.

  Using the slow clock input, the Tickless support is functional,
  however, there are inaccuracies  in delays.  For example,

    nsh&gt; sleep 10

  results in a delay of maybe 5.4 seconds.  But the timing accuracy is
  correct if all competing uses of the interval timer are disabled (mostly
  from the high priority work queue).  Therefore, I conclude that this
  inaccuracy is due to the inaccuracies in the representation of the clock
  rate.  30.518 usec cannot be represented accurately.   Each timing
  calculation results in a small error.  When the interval timer is very
  busy, long delays will be divided into many small pieces and each small
  piece has a large error in the calculation.  The cumulative error is the
  cause of the problem.

  Solution:  The same70-qmtech/src/sam_boot.c file has additional logic
  to enable the programmable clock PCK6 as a clock source for the
  timer/counters if the Tickless mode is selected.  The ideal frequency
  would be:

    frequency = 1,000,000 / CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK

  The main crystal is selected as the frequency source.  The maximum
  prescaler value is 256 so the minimum frequency is 46,875 Hz which
  corresponds to a period of 21.3 microseconds.  A value of
  CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK=20, or 50KHz, would give an exact solution with
  a divider of 240.

  SAME70 Timer Usage
  ------------------
  This current implementation uses two timers:  A one-shot timer to
  provide the timed events and a free running timer to provide the current
  time.  Since timers are a limited resource, that could be an issue on
  some systems.

  We could do the job with a single timer if we were to keep the single
  timer in a free-running at all times.  The SAME70 timer/counters have
  16-bit counters with the capability to generate a compare interrupt when
  the timer matches a compare value but also to continue counting without
  stopping (giving another, different interrupt when the timer rolls over
  from 0xffff to zero).  So we could potentially just set the compare at
  the number of ticks you want PLUS the current value of timer.  Then you
  could have both with a single timer:  An interval timer and a free-
  running counter with the same timer!  In this case, you would want to
  to set CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS_ALARM in the NuttX configuration.

  Patches are welcome!

Debugging
=========

  EDBG
  ----
  The on-board EDBG appears to work only with Atmel Studio.  You can however,
  simply connect a SAM-ICE or J-Link to the JTAG/SWD connector on the board
  and that works great.  The only tricky thing is getting the correct
  orientation of the JTAG connection.

  J-Link/JTAG
  -----------
  I have been using Atmel Studio to write code to flash then I use the Segger
  J-Link GDB server to debug.  I have been using the &#39;Device Programming&#39; I
  available under the Atmel Studio &#39;Tool&#39; menu.  I have to disconnect the
  SAM-ICE while programming with the EDBG.  I am sure that you could come up
  with a GDB server-only solution if you wanted.

  I run GDB like this from the directory containing the NuttX ELF file:

    arm-none-eabi-gdb
    (gdb) target remote localhost:2331
    (gdb) mon reset
    (gdb) file nuttx
    (gdb) ... start debugging ...

  OpenOCD/EDBG
  ------------
  Current OpenOCD also works with SAME70-QMTECH via EDBG, but I have not
  used OpenOCD with the board.

  SAM-BA
  ------
  SAM-BA is another option.  With SAM-BA, you can load code into FLASH over
  a serial port or USB connection by booting into the ROM bootloader.

  CMSIS-DAP Programmer
  --------------------
  Another useful tool for CMSIS-DAP programmer (formerly Atmel EDBG
  programmer) available at:

    https://github.com/ataradov/edbg

  This is a simple command line utility for programming ARM-based MCUs
  (currently only Atmel) though CMSIS-DAP SWD interface. It works on Linux,
  macOS and Windows.  Very useful to around especially if you have the
  following issue:

  Booting to FLASH or the ROM Bootloader
  --------------------------------------
  If you use EDBG or JTAG to load code into FLASH, you may be puzzled why
  the code does not run.  It may be that you are booting into the ROM
  bootloader instead of FLASH.  That can be fixed by modifying the SAME70&#39;s
  GPNVM bits.

  If your SAME70 is booting in ROM by default, the GPNVM bits will probably
  looking something like:

    $ edbg.exe -F r,:, -t atmel_cm7
    GPNVM Bits: 0x40

  Where bit 1 = 0 boots into the ROM bootloader and bit 1 = 1 boots into
  FLASH.  You want:

    $ edbg.exe -F r,:, -t atmel_cm7
    GPNVM Bits: 0x42

  If you are trying to use SAM-BA, you might have the opposity problem:
  The board might be booting into FLASH when you need it to boot into the
  ROM bootloader.

  That GPNVM bit can be changed using CMSIS-DAP programmer, Atmel studio, or
  using this OpenOCD setup:

    atsamv gpnvm [(&#39;clr&#39;|&#39;set&#39;|&#39;show&#39;) bitnum]
      Without arguments, shows all bits in the gpnvm register.
      Otherwise, clears, sets, or shows one General Purpose Non-Volatile
      Memory (gpnvm) bit.

  Perhaps SAM-BA supports a way to do this as well???

Using OpenOCD and GDB to flash via the EDBG chip
================================================

  Building OpenOCD under Cygwin:

    Refer to boards/olimex-lpc1766stk/README.txt

  Installing OpenOCD in Linux (but see note below):

    sudo apt-get install openocd

  NOTE: At the time of writing installing the above openocd package from
  the distribution (Ubuntu 14.04) was not enough to get the latest openocd
  version supporting the SAME70 Xplained.

  The code was obtained from the OpenOCD git repository, available at
  https://github.com/ntfreak/openocd.

    git clone https://github.com/ntfreak/openocd.git

  Then follow the directions of the &quot;Building OpenOCD&quot; section of their README,
  but be sure to configure including the CMSIS-DAP interface:

    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --enable-cmsis-dap
    make
    sudo make install

  If your configure step fails, you might be missing some dependencies, i.e.:

    sudo apt-get install libhidapi-dev

  Helper Scripts.

    OpenOCD requires a configuration file.  I keep the one I used last here:

      boards/arm/samv7/same70-qmtech/tools/atmel_same70_qmtech.cfg

    However, the &quot;correct&quot; configuration script to use with OpenOCD may
    change as the features of OpenOCD evolve.  So you should at least
    compare that atmel_same70_qmtech.cfg file with configuration files in
    /usr/share/openocd/scripts.  As of this writing, the configuration
    files of interest were:

      /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/cmsis-dap.cfg
      /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/atmel_same70_qmtech.cfg
      /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/atsamv.cfg

    There is also a script on the tools/ directory that I use to start
    the OpenOCD daemon on my system called oocd.sh.  That script will
    probably require some modifications to work in another environment:

    - Possibly the value of OPENOCD_PATH and TARGET_PATH
    - It assumes that the correct script to use is the one at
      boards/arm/samv7/same70-qmtech/tools/atmel_same70_qmtech.cfg

  Starting OpenOCD

    Then you should be able to start the OpenOCD daemon like:

      boards/arm/samv7/same70-qmtech/tools/oocd.sh $PWD

  Connecting GDB

    Once the OpenOCD daemon has been started, you can connect to it via
    GDB using the following GDB command:

      arm-nuttx-elf-gdb
      (gdb) target remote localhost:3333

    NOTE:  The name of your GDB program may differ.  For example, with the
    CodeSourcery toolchain, the ARM GDB would be called arm-none-eabi-gdb.

    After starting GDB, you can load the NuttX ELF file:

      (gdb) symbol-file nuttx
      (gdb) monitor reset
      (gdb) monitor halt
      (gdb) load nuttx

    NOTES:
    1. Loading the symbol-file is only useful if you have built NuttX to
       include debug symbols (by setting CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=y in the
       .config file).
    2. The MCU must be halted prior to loading code using &#39;mon reset&#39;
       as described below.

    OpenOCD will support several special &#39;monitor&#39; commands.  These
    GDB commands will send comments to the OpenOCD monitor.  Here
    are a couple that you will need to use:

     (gdb) monitor reset
     (gdb) monitor halt

    NOTES:
    1. The MCU must be halted using &#39;mon halt&#39; prior to loading code.
    2. Reset will restart the processor after loading code.
    3. The &#39;monitor&#39; command can be abbreviated as just &#39;mon&#39;.

Configurations
==============

Information Common to All Configurations
----------------------------------------
Each SAME70-QMTECH configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow:

  tools/configure.sh same70-qmtech:&lt;subdir&gt;

Before building, make sure that the PATH environment variable include the
correct path to the directory than holds your toolchain binaries.

And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

  make oldconfig
  make

The &lt;subdir&gt; that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
must be is one of the following.

NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute &#39;make menuconfig&#39; in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on USART1 (the EDBG VCOM)

     NOTE: When USART1 is used, the pin PB4 is reconfigured.  Normally, PB4
     is TDI.  When it is reconfigured for use with USART1, the capability to
     debug is lost!  If you plan to debug you should most certainly not use
     USART1.  UART3 might be a good option (the Arduino RXD/TXD):

       -CONFIG_SAMV7_USART1=y
       -CONFIG_USART1_SERIALDRIVER=y
       -CONFIG_USART1_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
       -CONFIG_USART1_RXBUFSIZE=256
       -CONFIG_USART1_TXBUFSIZE=256
       -CONFIG_USART1_BAUD=115200
       -CONFIG_USART1_BITS=8
       -CONFIG_USART1_PARITY=0
       -CONFIG_USART1_2STOP=0

       +CONFIG_SAMV7_UART3=y
       +CONFIG_UART3_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
       +CONFIG_UART3_RXBUFSIZE=256
       +CONFIG_UART3_TXBUFSIZE=256
       +CONFIG_UART3_BAUD=115200
       +CONFIG_UART3_BITS=8
       +CONFIG_UART3_PARITY=0
       +CONFIG_UART3_2STOP=0

     UART3 is not the default because (1) the placement of the RJ-45 connector
     makes it difficult to install Arduino shield cards and (2) the Arduino
     connectors are not populated on the board as it comes from the factory.

  3. All of these configurations are set up to build under Windows using the
     &quot;GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors&quot; that is maintained by ARM
     (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).

       https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

     That toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using
     &#39;make menuconfig&#39;.  Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

     System Type -&gt; Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABI=y  : GNU ARM EABI toolchain

     NOTE: As of this writing, there are issues with using this tool at
     the -Os level of optimization.  This has not been proven to be a
     compiler issue (as least not one that might not be fixed with a
     well placed volatile qualifier).  However, in any event, it is
     recommend that you use not more that -O2 optimization.

Configuration sub-directories
-----------------------------

  adc

    This is a basic nsh configuration (se below) with added example for
    ADC (AFEC) driver. Data can be read through channel AFE0_AD0 by
    running application &quot;adc&quot; in NuttShell.

    The ADC is triggered by Timer/counter at 1 kHz frequency and uses
    DMA to transfer samples. Number of transferred samples can be set
    by configuring CONFIG_SAMV7_AFEC_DMASAMPLES.

  nsh:

    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  There are two
    very similar NSH configurations:

      - nsh.  This configuration is focused on low level, command-line
        driver testing.  It has no network.
      - netnsh.  This configuration is focused on network testing and
        has only limited command support.

    NOTES:

    1. The serial console is configured by default for use with the EDBG VCOM
       (USART1).  You will need to reconfigure if you will to use a different
       U[S]ART.  See &quot;Information Common to All Configurations&quot; above.

    2. Default stack sizes are large and should really be tuned to reduce
       the RAM footprint:

         CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK=2048
         CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE=1024
         CONFIG_INIT_STACKSIZE=2048

       &quot;Auto-Mounter&quot;.

    5. Performance-related Configuration settings:

       CONFIG_ARMV7M_ICACHE=y                : Instruction cache is enabled
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_DCACHE=y                : Data cache is enabled
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_DCACHE_WRITETHROUGH=n   : Write back mode
       CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y                     : H/W floating point support is enabled
       CONFIG_ARCH_DPFPU=y                   : 64-bit H/W floating point support is enabled

       # CONFIG_ARMV7M_ITCM is not set       : Support not yet in place
       # CONFIG_ARMV7M_DTCM is not set       : Support not yet in place

       Stack sizes are also large to simplify the bring-up and should be
       tuned for better memory usages.

    STATUS:
    2015-03-28: HSMCI TX DMA is disabled.  There are some issues with the TX
      DMA that need to be corrected.
