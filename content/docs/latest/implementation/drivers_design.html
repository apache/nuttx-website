<h1>OS Drivers Design<a class="headerlink" href="#os-drivers-design" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>There are three kinds of drivers that are recognized by the OS and are visible to
applications. Two are POSIX standard device driver types, one is non-standard.
There are also internal OS components that may also be considered to be drivers
or, more correctly, lower-half drivers. Details about these are given below.</p>
<section id="character-and-block-drivers">
<h2>Character and Block Drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#character-and-block-drivers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The standard driver types include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Character Drivers</strong>. First there are the character drivers These are drivers
that support user accessibility via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read()</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">write()</span></code> etc. The others do
not naturally. Character drivers implement a stream of incoming or outgoing bytes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Block Drivers</strong>. These are used to support files systems that supported
block-oriented I/O, not a character stream. The user cannot <em>directly</em> access
block drivers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The user can, however, access block drivers indirectly through a character driver proxy.
Both character and block drivers are represented by device nodes, usually in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev</span></code>.
But if you try to open the block driver, something very strange happens: A temporary,
nameless proxy character driver is automatically instantiated that maps a character
driver’s byte stream into blocks and mediates the driver access to the block driver.
This is the logic in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">drivers/bch</span></code>. BCH stands for block to character. So from the
application point of view, the both seem to be character drivers and applications
can interact with both in the same way.</p>
<p>This capability is exploited, for example, by the NuttX file system formatting
applications like mkfatfs to format a FAT system on a block driver.</p>
<p>There is also the complement, the loop device that converts a character driver into
a block driver. Loop devices are commonly used to format a file system image in RAM.</p>
</section>
<section id="mtd-drivers">
<h2>MTD Drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#mtd-drivers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>And the non-standard driver is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>Memory Technology Driver (MTD)</strong>. This naming was borrowed from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">infradead.org</span></code>,
but does not derive from any of their MTD logic. The MTD driver manages memory-based
devices like FLASH or EEPROM. And MTD FLASH memory driver is very similar to a block
driver but FLASH has some different properties, most notably that you have to erase
FLASH before you write to it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>MTD has the same conveniences as block drivers: Then can appear as device nodes
under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev</span></code> and can be proxied to behave like character drivers if the opened
as character drivers. Plus they have some additional twists: MTD drivers can be
stacked one on top of another to extend the capabilities of the lower level MTD
driver. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">drivers/mtd/sector512.c</span></code> is an MTD driver that when layered
on top of another MTD driver, it changes the apparent page size of the FLASH to
512 bytes.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">drivers/mtd/mtd_partitions.c</span></code> can be used to break up a large FLASH into
separate, independent partitions, each of which looks like another MTD driver.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">drivers/mtd/ftl.c</span></code> is also interesting. FTL stands for FLASH Translation Layer.
The FTL driver is an MTD driver that when layered on top of another MTD driver,
converts the MTD driver to a block driver. The permutations are endless.</p>

<section id="monolithic-drivers">
<h2>Monolithic Drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#monolithic-drivers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When one thinks about device drivers in an OS, one thinks of a single thing,
a single block in a block diagram with these two primary interfaces:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The device monolithic driver exposes a single, standard device driver interface.
With the <strong>Virtual File System (VFS)</strong>, this provides the application user interface
to the driver functionality. And</p></li>
<li><p>A low-level interface to the hardware that is managed by the device driver.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="upper-half-and-lower-half-drivers">
<h2>Upper Half and Lower Half Drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#upper-half-and-lower-half-drivers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>NuttX supports many, many different MCU platforms, each with many similar but
distinct built-in peripherals.
Certainly we could imagine a realization where each such peripheral is supported
by monolithic driver as described in the preceding paragraph.
That would involve a lot code duplication, however.
The MCU peripherals may be unique at a low, register-level interface.
However, the peripherals are really very similar at a higher level of abstraction.</p>
<p>NuttX reduces the duplication, both in the code and in driver development,
using the notion of <em>Upper Half</em> and <em>Lower Half</em> drivers.
Such an implementation results in two things; two blocks in the system block
diagram: The upper half driver in a group of common, shared drivers, and
the MCU-specific lower half driver.</p>
<p>As before, each of these two driver components has two functional interfaces.
For the upper half driver:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The upper half device driver exposes a single, standard driver interface.
With the <strong>Virtual File System (VFS)</strong>, this, again, provides the application
user interface to the driver functionality. And</p></li>
<li><p>The upper-half side of the lower-half interface to the MCU-specific hardware
that is managed by the lower-half device driver.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And for the lower half driver:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The lower-half side of the interface to the the upper0half driver, and</p></li>
<li><p>The low-level interface to the hardware that is managed by the lower half
device driver.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="one-to-many-encapsulation-and-polymorphism">
<h3>One to Many: Encapsulation and Polymorphism<a class="headerlink" href="#one-to-many-encapsulation-and-polymorphism" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>These modular upper- and lower-half drivers have certain properties that you
would associate with an object oriented design: Encapsulation, data abstraction,
and polymorphism certainly.
Because of this encapsulation, the upper-half driver is complete unaware of any
implementation details within the lower-half driver.
Everything needed for the upper- and lower-half drivers to integrate is provided
by the defined interface between between those two things.
In fact, a single upper-half driver may service many lower-half driver instances
in a one-to-many relationship.</p>
<p>As an example, some MCUs support UARTs, USARTs functioning as UARTs,
Low-Power UARTs (LPUARTs), and other Flexible devices that may function as UARTs.
Each of these is managed by a separate lower-half driver that can be found in the
appropriate <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/</span></code> directory under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">arch/</span></code>.
In addition a board could have off-chip, external 16550 UART hardware (which has
a common lower-half driver).
Yet all of them would be supported by the single, common, serial upper half
driver that can be found at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">drivers/serial/serial.c</span></code>.
This is only possible due to the object-like properties of the lower-half driver
implementations.</p>
