## Apache NuttX

NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards
compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller
environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI
standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's (such as
VxWorks) are adopted for functionality not available under these standards, or
for functionality that is not appropriate for deeply-embedded environments (such
as fork()).
