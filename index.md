## Apache NuttX

NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards
compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 64-bit microcontroller
environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI
standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's (such as
VxWorks) are adopted for functionality not available under these standards, or
for functionality that is not appropriate for deeply-embedded environments (such
as fork()).

the applications that use it, and the hardware on which it typically runs.
The target audience is embedded systems practitioners across both industry and
academia.
