## Apache NuttX

NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards
compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 64-bit microcontroller
environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI
standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's (such as
VxWorks) are adopted for functionality not available under these standards, or
for functionality that is not appropriate for deeply-embedded environments (such
as fork()).


## Community Events

### International Workshop 2024

The [Apache NuttX International Workshop]({{ site.data.project.community_events }})
is organized every year. You can attend online or in person for free.
This year we meet on 13-14 Jun 2024 at Sony Office, Tokyo, Japan. See you there!

Please visit [events website]({{ site.data.project.community_events }}) for more details.
You can join the event at [LinkedIn]({{ site.data.project.community_events_workshop_2024_linkedin_event }}).
[Call For Papers](({{ site.data.project.community_events_workshop_2024_cfp }}) is now open!

The scope of the workshop is the Apache Nuttx® Real Time Operating System, the
tools used for its design, development, deployment, debugging, and maintenance,
the applications that use it, and the hardware on which it typically runs.
The target audience is embedded systems practitioners across both industry and
academia.

Apache NuttX® International Workshop has four primary objectives; (i) To allow
the developers and users of Apache NuttX® to meet up, to network together,
exchange ideas, and to understand their mutual needs and aspirations for the
OS. (ii) To agree on directions for the future development of Apache NuttX®
together with Apache Software Foundation and to coalesce development groups
to work on these initiatives. (iii) To raise the profile of Apache NuttX®
and allow potential adopters from around the world to see how widely it is
already used and (iv) to understand how we can make the development process
for Apache NuttX® more diverse and robust.

Participation at the workshop shall be limited to 200 attendees and we
strongly prefer delegates that will contribute to the event. Active
participation may take a form of short lecture or full presentation.
All proposals will be considered with a duration from 20 minutes (short
lecture) to 40 minutes (full presentation).
