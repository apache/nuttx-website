# How to update the project's web site

## Running locally

Before opening a pull request, you can preview your contributions by
running from within the directory:

```
1. bundle exec jekyll serve
2. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
```

## Pushing to site

Site is updated by a CI job that runs the `publish.sh` script. Once this
runs it the results will be visible [here](https://nuttx.apache.org).

### Force Deployment

If a dependency has changed such as the external documentation you may
need to force the deployment CI to run. This can be done from the [CI
Actions](https://github.com/apache/nuttx-website/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)
tab and selecting **Run workflow** -> **Branch: master** --> **Run workflow**

## Adding contributors

To add a contributor to the project, or to modify existing contributors,
edit `site/_data/contributors.yml`.
The [project members](http://localhost:4000/community.html#project-members)
list will re-generate.
